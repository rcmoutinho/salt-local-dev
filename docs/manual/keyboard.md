### How to write English, Portuguese, and French

Sometimes, what is supposed to be simple takes a lot of time. On Windows and macOS, there are straightforward keyboard types for writing multiple languages. Ubuntu seems to have it, too, but with some caveats.

The `English (US, intl., with dead keys)` option might be everything you need, but you will either need to learn extra shortcuts or make some changes to overcome them.

<kbd>Alt Gr</kbd>, most know as your <kbd>Right Alt</kbd>, will be your best friend on this journey. There are some letters that you need to combine with <kbd>Alt Gr</kbd> to get what you want _(have fun mapping and trying things)_. Some keys work fine, just typing twice like `~`. The ones that I most use so far:

- <kbd>Alt Gr</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> = <kbd>ç</kbd>
- <kbd>Alt Gr</kbd> + <kbd>'</kbd> = <kbd>'</kbd> _(same as <kbd>'</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> = <kbd>'</kbd>)_
- <kbd>Alt Gr</kbd> + <kbd>"</kbd> = <kbd>"</kbd> _(same as <kbd>"</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> = <kbd>"</kbd>)_

I have accepted the need to adapt to their differences, but only after learning how to work around them if needed. If I change my mind or you want to write `ç` in the usual way (:laughing:), the following references will give you the explanation and potential fixes (I haven't tested them yet - do so at your own risk):

> _**NOTE:** I searched a bit for how I could automate this configuration via CLI, but it can go too deep and take a while for something that requires just one click to manage. I won't do it now._
