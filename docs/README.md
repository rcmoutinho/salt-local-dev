# Documentation

You can find here extra information about everything available on this project, plus extra notes on how to debug multiple types of challenges.

## OS Installation

There is no point in replicating great and updated documentation on installing an OS when there is an official source. A pen drive and an additional computer will, most of the time, help you manage all the steps needed to set up a second computer.

- [Install Ubuntu desktop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview)
  - You can get up to 5 licenses from the [PRO version](https://ubuntu.com/pro) for personal use
  - [Get started with Ubuntu Pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro/tutorial)
- [Install macOS](./manual/macos.md)

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This is a quick way to collect and organize all common problems according to tools, operating systems, etc. Check the folder [docs/faq](./faq/) for all the details.

## Manual Installations

Not everything is straightforward to automate. There are some of them: the time to implement a solution is just way more what is worth to have it, or there are too many specific user interactions to try to automate, or it will still be very unstable to manage, or it could be a limitation from the tool, or I don't know how to do yet :smile:

Check the folder [docs/manual](./manual/) for all the details.

## Extra Troubleshooting

Some states contain deeper documentation about the implementation's hows and whys. If you are having issues, you might want to check some of them.
